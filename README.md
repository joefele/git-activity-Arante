# git-activity-Arante
Hi everyone! My name is Joefele Keate T. Arante.
A 3rd-Year BSIT student in University of San Jose-Recoletos.
Git is a tool to track and monitor changes or modifications in the code. While, Github is an online platform which is similar to Google Drives and such, where you can store projects and just like canva, we can collaborate with others.
